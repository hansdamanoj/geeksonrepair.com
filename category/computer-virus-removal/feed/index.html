										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Geeks on Repair, we see all sorts of viruses come through our shop. While we gladly help our customers with virus removal services, we also always try to educate them on how to prevent viruses from infecting their PCs in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below, we have provided 5 very simple and smart ways to prevent viruses from taking refuge in your system. As a starting note, we also want you to note the difference between malware and a virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is a Computer Virus?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A virus can best be described as malicious computer software that copies itself into your computer and infects it. Viruses can easily be transferred to your system through local private/public networks, the internet, or through a USB/external hard drive.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here at Geeks on Repair, we have dealt with so many virus removal jobs where the virus was actually hidden in the customer’s flash drive the whole time. As soon as we cleaned their system and they went home, the virus would come back when they connected their flash drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Malware?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malware is a program that is made to deny operation on a system. It can also gather information from a system, or gain access to crucial system resources.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Malware is a very tricky program that takes extra effort to remove. Typical anti-virus programs do not have the right tools to detect and remove malware, so it is very important that you do everything in your power to prevent it from infecting your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">5 Smart Ways to Prevent Viruses From Infecting Your Computer</h2>
<p>Here are some ways you can prevent viruses and malware from infecting your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Keep Windows Up to Date</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Since Microsoft Windows is susceptible to viruses and malware more than most other operating systems, it is important to keep it updated. I know how annoying it is to see an ‘update’ window popup every time you turn your system on, but it is important to let it do its thing.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the updates released by Microsoft for Windows 7,8 and 10 include crucial security patches that fill security loopholes in the system. And not to mention, viruses keep evolving, so the team at Microsoft has to keep updating the system to fight back new and complex viruses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use Only One Anti-Virus Program</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We’ve met a lot of customers in our shop that has multiple anti-virus programs running on their computer. While it may seem that having multiple anti-virus software is a good defense against viruses, unfortunately, it’s not.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-virus programs have special instances running in the background that check every new thing being added to the system. From the pictures to the music and video files, whenever something is added to the system, the anti-virus program checks it before it is added.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When multiple such programs are running in the background, they can start to interfere with each other which can be taxing for your system resources. So in other words, stick to a single program and keep it updated at all times.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scan Email Attachments</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A lot of people get their systems infected via scam emails. Hackers send scam emails with clever email addresses that convince the user to download attachments from the email or click on malicious links.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With a good anti-virus program, you can easily scan email attachments and protect your computer from being infected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Get Malware Scanner</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malware scanners are different from anti-virus programs and you should at least have one of them running in the background. Since anti-virus software can’t detect and remove malware, your only hope of getting rid of one is by using the anti-malware program.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing is that most anti-malware software is free to use, so don’t hesitate to have one on your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use a Trusted Browser</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many internet browsers out there and you should choose the one that provides the best security features. We recommend using Google Chrome or Firefox for most of your browsing needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Get Professional Virus Removal Services Today</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style=font-size:30px;>A virus attacking your computer can feel like a personal attack on everything you have worked so hard to create.</h1>
<p>In today’s world, our computers hold all our personal and business information. Understanding how computer viruses work and how to shield your data will provide you with the ability to protect your computer and your information. There are a few myth’s about computer viruses and its removal that must be addressed in order to protect your computer.</p>
<p>While the Window’s OS is more susceptible to a virus that does not mean the Mac’s OS system and the Linux are guarded against a virus. An example of a virus that will attack all 3 operating systems is a Trojan virus. A Trojan virus is presented as a legitimate software option, only for the victim to discover they have downloaded a virus. However, as the victim, there are things you can do to avoid downloading a Trojan virus.</p>
<h2 style=font-size:20px;>Don’t open an email from anyone you do not know.</h2>
<p>Don’t download software from an unfamiliar site.</p>
<p>Don’t give out your password to anyone, they don’t need it if they are a legitimate company.</p>
<p>Don’t click on suspicious links sent to you even if you know who sent the file. Always go directly to the website to verify the link is correct.</p>
<p>Never download from an adult site.</p>
<p>Following these few rules will save you from having to hire a specialist to fix your computer. And in rare cases buy a new computer altogether.</p>
<p>No! A virus cannot cause your computer to explode or catch fire. However, a virus can corrupt your BIO’s, a firmware used during booting process of all computers. If your BIO’s become corrupt, unless you know what you are doing, it is off to the computer store to get your computer fixed.</p>
<p>If you receive a blue screen on your monitor don’t worry this is not a virus. This is usually a bad driver or a hardware issue. When you restart your computer, press F8 (on most computers), check the owner’s manual for a specific key. This will allow you to see the error message, so you know what is wrong with the computer. In most cases, you can google the error messages and fix the issue yourself or contact us to provide help with the issue.</p>
<p>Remember it is important to follow the suggestions above in order to avoid getting a virus. The blog post is here to help you avoid those pesky viruses and provide you with all the information to protect your valuable computer files.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Although there has been a lot of effort and money put into creating secure operating systems for our many machines, the hopes of full protection from viruses, infections, worms and more is still unattainable.</h1>
<p><strong>It is true things aren’t as bad as in the past, where hackers were able to do and undo at will, things have gotten better, but,  the reality is that despite the passage of time and the advance of versions, security problems are still very present, and even today,  it is still absolutely necessary to have a powerful antivirus and other applications that complement security.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Added to this, we must bear in mind that hackers always take advantage of the launching of new versions of operating systems, to find holes in the security of new and so unknown programs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A new version of the operating system brings a huge amount of changes and in those changes is where there is room for failure, and in those failures is where the vulnerabilities might be found, hence our recommendation is always to keep your equipment updated, so if ultimately you do run into trouble ,  we will be able to deal with less virus and problems instead of more.</strong></p>
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">If the worst does happen, and you find your machine hacked or infected, we are here for you.</h2>
<p><strong>Here is a list of just some of the things our great techs can handle for you and your machines the day you get infected:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kill malicious processes, even hidden ones</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stop malicious services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove malicious DLLs from processes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove auto start entries, including those from the registry</strong></p>
<p><strong>Delete records hijacks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solve DNS hijacks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solve Proxy hijacks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fix Host hijacks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solve problems in the boot sector (MBR)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Restore the damages caused</strong></p>
