                <![CDATA[<p>You’ve finally got the TV of your dreams, and you couldn’t be more excited to enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows with your family and friends. There’s just one problem…</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 35px;">The TV has yet to be installed, and you have no idea where to start.</h1>
<p>Luckily for you, we’ve compiled some of the best tips to find the best local TV installers in your area for a hassle-free experience. The cost of your TV is a huge financial investment of its own, so you never want to skimp out on proper installation.</p>
<p>In a way, TV installation services are kind of a form of insurance for your TV: If you choose to get proper services now to ensure your TV is properly installed, it’s more likely to last longer and be used with care.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here is our expert advice for finding the best local TV installers near you.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1524" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1-300x200.png" alt="Professional TV Installers" width="536" height="358" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Use Crowd-Sourced Reviews</h2>
<p>In addition to using all the available information on the company’s website, make sure you seek out crowd-sourced reviews. This will allow you to get a clear picture of what to expect from your potential installation company.</p>
<p>Many crowd-sourced review sites like angieslist.com and trustpiolit.com do their best to only display the reviews of verified service users. Therefore, a quick preemptive search could save you a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Ask Family Members and Friends For Advice</h2>
<p>Make sure to reach out to those you trust the most for reliable TV installation recommendations. Your family members probably have a good idea of what services would work best for your specific needs.</p>
<p>Plus, getting a specific name or company referral from someone you trust keeps the installation company as accountable as possible. You may feel uncomfortable bothering your family members for advice, but don’t be. Instead, be sure to offer up your own solid service recommendations in the future.</p>
<p>That way, you can build your network together in the most efficient and effective way possible. It’s likely that someone in your personal sphere has required a TV installation at some point in time, so take advantage of their pasts knowledge and experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Know Your TV Beforehand</h2>
<p>One of the best ways you can prepare for <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair/">local TV installers</a> is by knowing your device inside and out. It’s likely that your installation company will have questions regarding your TV during your initial consultation, so prepare yourself accordingly.</p>
<p>What specific make and model of TV do you have? Is it covered by a manufacturer’s warranty? Are there any smart devices you’re looking to connect to your TV? All of this information can be found via your manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>Have your serial and product number ready by checking the original packaging or the backside of your device. The more information you can gather preemptively, the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Comparatively Shop</h2>
<p>If you have the time to do so, don’t settle on the first TV installation company you come across. Instead, comparatively shop across a couple of potential service providers.</p>
<p>Try to consider important factors like budget, customer service, and overall ease of access. You’ll find that some companies even have a price match guarantee for quotes by their competitors, so don’t be afraid to negotiate when it’s time to set pricing.</p>
<p>As a valued customer, you deserve to be treated with kindness and care. Don’t settle for any business that treats you like anything less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Have Your Mount Ready</h2>
<p>One of the most important factors to consider when getting your TV installed is the mount itself. For example, if you’re mounting your TV v.s onto a dresser, your technician will approach your service package completely differently.</p>
<p>Map out exactly where you want your TV, and double-check to ensure that your mount will be able to support your device’s weight at any particular angle. If you don’t have a mount yet, look for services who offer custom mounts as a part of their service package.</p>
<p>While this will likely make for an added expense, you’ll be getting the valuable peace of mind knowing that your mount was expertly crafted by an experienced professional.</p>
<p>Also consider cable management options, especially if you have children or pets at home. While added cables can make proper TV installation more of a challenge, your TV technician should have the chops necessary to make this process a breeze.</p>
<p>Ask about your potential company’s expertise with cable management during your initial call to make this feature a priority. With clear and proper communication, you’re bound to get the best TV installation experience possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Look For Local TV Installation Services</h2>
<p>If at all possible, look for local TV installation companies. Not only will this save you time and effort, but oftentimes smaller, brick-and-mortar companies are able to offer more specialized service.</p>
<p>Large conglomerates may have more familiar names and a variety of reviews, but they aren’t able to offer the individualized care that comes from smaller based installers.</p>
<p>Plus, the less a technician has to travel, the more likely it is that you’ll be offered more affordable services. Remember, travel costs are part of what you’re paying when you order installation services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Referral Bonuses</h2>
<p>Another great benefit of reach out to family and friends is the possibility of earning a referral bonus for either you or your close friend. Plenty of installation companies, particularly local, are happy to offer discounted services and special features to loyal customers willing to refer more clients.</p>
<p>Take advantage of this benefit and scope out any potential services within your personal sphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Find Proper TV Installation Effectively</h2>
<p>Finding a reputable service provider can be tricky, but it doesn’t have to be. Hopefully, some of these tips gave you more of a well-rounded strategy for finding TV installation services without a whole lot of extra hassle.</p>

                <![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Finding a local TV installer you can trust can be a stressful process.</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your TV can be a huge expense on its own, so you definitely want to invest in professionals who can set it up both properly and securely. At the same time, you don’t want to break your budget in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, we’ve compiled 5 of the best ways to find TV install</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ers to ease your search. With these simple yet effective pointers, you’ll be sure to find quality installers without emptying out your wallet.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1475" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aa-300x188.png" alt="Best Local TV Installers" width="417" height="261" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aa-300x188.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aa-768x480.png 768w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aa-1024x640.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research your TV</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best things you can do before finding a local Television insta</span>ller is reading up all you can regarding your TV. Be sure to use traditional search engines like Google, but also try video sites like YouTube<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give you inspiration for setup ideas and a more hands-on introduct</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ion to your product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many devices are you hoping to connect to it? What kind of power supply does it require? These are all questions that will make the process of finding a television installer that much easier and efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your installation professional’s quality of service will be exponentially higher should you put in the time to learn about your TV beforehand. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan out your TV’s location</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to learning more about the TV itself, it’s wise to plan out exactly where you want your TV to find the best TV installer available for your vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies offer to connect your TV to compatible devices. If this is the case, make sure your setup has an appropriate amount of cables and connections so the installation can be executed properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unsure what cables and connection devices you may need, the installation professional may be able to answer your questions - Try to write out all the possible speakers, streaming devices, and mobile phones you may want to connect to your TV beforehand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you be planning to mount your device, make sure your mount has the appropriate weight limits and dimensions according to your TV’s parameters. Though this may seem obvious, it’s easy to get caught up in this stressful process, so try to minimize any errors by double-checking your numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some may provide their own bracket or mount for you to use, oftentimes these come at an extra cost so plan your budget accordingly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mounting and Bracket Options</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While planning out the desired space for your TV, be sure to consider the full scope of mounting and bracket options available. There are mounts that rest on the wall, from the ceiling or act as a part of a larger fixture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you may want to consider whether or not you need your TV mount to swivel or pivot on an axis. These factors will all alter how a TV installer approaches your personalized service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, many brackets come with a couple of different sizing options. Be sure to do your research and figure out the exact desired setting of your bracket to save time and money during your installation appointment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in an apartment or rent your home, be sure to double-check with the landlord that installing a mount on the wall is acceptable. Though it may be a small change, taking the time to get formally approved by your landlord could save you your valuable security deposit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget to plan out extra tiny expenses that may come with the installation process. Many TV owners recommend the use of cable ties or organizers to keep their TV areas tidy. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bb.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1476" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bb-300x200.png" alt="Best Local TV Installers" width="661" height="441" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bb-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bb.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word-of-mouth Recommendations</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to find a local Television installer you can trust is by asking your family and friends. If at all possible, try to get a specific name. When you call and request service for the installation, request the referred technician.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only will this professional likely be someone you can trust, but using a direct name makes them more likely to be accountable for their actions and offer top-quality service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, some companies also have referral incentives, and in which case, your friends and family members will be more than happy to refer to a television installer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re still wary of their personal recommendation on its own, see if the company offers preemptive consultation over the </span><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/contact-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">phone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This small extra step can offer you priceless peace of mind, and also give the installation company a clear idea of how they should direct your personalized service. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowd-Sourced Reviews</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not having any luck getting referrals through your family and friends, the next best step is to scour crowd-sourced review sites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sites like Yelp that traditionally only hosted restaurant ratings and reviews now extend their services out to local businesses, such as TV installers. The businesses themselves are not able to remove and negative reviews, only reply to them, so oftentimes these are great unbiased sources of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Google now allows business listings to host customer reviews, so you can easily type in a business name via the search engine and gain almost instantaneous </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;ei=ajPEXcbdCMOvggf21aW4CQ&amp;q=geeks+on+repair&amp;oq=geeks+on+repair&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l6j0i22i30l3j38.319260.321870..322076...0.1..0.93.993.15......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i67j0i10.YHCV14tuJHQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGupnMsNjlAhXDl-AKHfZqCZcQ4dUDCAs&amp;uact=5#lrd=0x89c2f47f2131b277:0x7d85eb1752e21b97,1,,,"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding the quality of their services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also other crowd-sourced review sites like Trust Pilot and Angie’s List to assist in your search. When in doubt, try to search across multiple platforms to get a general consensus of the company’s operations and quality of service. If the installer is consistently receiving high marks on multiple platforms, then it’s likely a great choice for service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">                                                                                                      ***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding great <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair/">local TV installers</a> can be a stressful process, but it doesn’t have to be. Hopefully, these tips make your installation as smooth as possible - Just remember to do preemptive quality research, and scope out companies you can trust. </span></p>
