										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Geeks on Repair, we see all sorts of viruses come through our shop. While we gladly help our customers with virus removal services, we also always try to educate them on how to prevent viruses from infecting their PCs in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below, we have provided 5 very simple and smart ways to prevent viruses from taking refuge in your system. As a starting note, we also want you to note the difference between malware and a virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is a Computer Virus?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A virus can best be described as malicious computer software that copies itself into your computer and infects it. Viruses can easily be transferred to your system through local private/public networks, the internet, or through a USB/external hard drive.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here at Geeks on Repair, we have dealt with so many virus removal jobs where the virus was actually hidden in the customer’s flash drive the whole time. As soon as we cleaned their system and they went home, the virus would come back when they connected their flash drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Malware?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malware is a program that is made to deny operation on a system. It can also gather information from a system, or gain access to crucial system resources.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Malware is a very tricky program that takes extra effort to remove. Typical anti-virus programs do not have the right tools to detect and remove malware, so it is very important that you do everything in your power to prevent it from infecting your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">5 Smart Ways to Prevent Viruses From Infecting Your Computer</h2>
<p>Here are some ways you can prevent viruses and malware from infecting your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Keep Windows Up to Date</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Since Microsoft Windows is susceptible to viruses and malware more than most other operating systems, it is important to keep it updated. I know how annoying it is to see an ‘update’ window popup every time you turn your system on, but it is important to let it do its thing.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the updates released by Microsoft for Windows 7,8 and 10 include crucial security patches that fill security loopholes in the system. And not to mention, viruses keep evolving, so the team at Microsoft has to keep updating the system to fight back new and complex viruses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use Only One Anti-Virus Program</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We’ve met a lot of customers in our shop that has multiple anti-virus programs running on their computer. While it may seem that having multiple anti-virus software is a good defense against viruses, unfortunately, it’s not.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-virus programs have special instances running in the background that check every new thing being added to the system. From the pictures to the music and video files, whenever something is added to the system, the anti-virus program checks it before it is added.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When multiple such programs are running in the background, they can start to interfere with each other which can be taxing for your system resources. So in other words, stick to a single program and keep it updated at all times.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scan Email Attachments</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A lot of people get their systems infected via scam emails. Hackers send scam emails with clever email addresses that convince the user to download attachments from the email or click on malicious links.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With a good anti-virus program, you can easily scan email attachments and protect your computer from being infected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Get Malware Scanner</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malware scanners are different from anti-virus programs and you should at least have one of them running in the background. Since anti-virus software can’t detect and remove malware, your only hope of getting rid of one is by using the anti-malware program.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing is that most anti-malware software is free to use, so don’t hesitate to have one on your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use a Trusted Browser</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many internet browsers out there and you should choose the one that provides the best security features. We recommend using Google Chrome or Firefox for most of your browsing needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Get Professional Virus Removal Services Today</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>REMOVE TROJAN VIRUS</h1>
<p>REMOVE TROJAN VIRUS - Today, viruses are a real nightmare for any internet user. Among them, some called "Trojan" viruses are the most prevalent. Its name comes from the mythological Trojan horse which appeared to be a gift to Troy, but hid inside a Greek army, that later attacked, and the city it attacked then fell like dominoes. In computing, the Trojans refer to programs that appear to be useful software but actually endanger security and can harm your <a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/contact-us/">computer</a>. Trojans spread when users open a program they believe is a legitimate source but is not.</p>
<h2>Some signs that our computer is infected with a Trojan:</h2>
<p>1- computer restarts on its own;<br />
2. system works very slowly;<br />
3. operating system will not boot;<br />
4- files have disappeared;<br />
5- you have open windows with advertisements or pornography.<br />
General procedure so you can remove them from your computer.</p>
<h3>Remove Trojan viruses</h3>
<p>1. Download and install an updated antivirus. Here are the best free antivirus</p>
<p>There are many versions available "free" antivirus. One that can be recommended is AVG Anti-Virus, which does not take up too much space and is easy to use.</p>
<p>2. Disconnect from internet whether you use an ADSL modem, a network interface card or plate  wi-fi.</p>
<p>3. Open your web browser and delete the cache and cookies.</p>
<p>To delete cookies in Internet Explorer follow these steps: Tools &gt;&gt; Internet Options &gt;&gt; in the General tab choose "Delete Cookies". Pc ask if "you want to delete all cookies in the folder of temporary Internet files?" Click OK.<br />
To clear the cache in Internet Explorer complete the following steps: Tools &gt;&gt; Internet Options &gt;&gt; in the General tab select Delete Files. Estate sure he labeled the box that says "Delete all offline content". Click OK.<br />
4. Restart the computer in "safe mode"</p>
<p>- For this, just you see the Windows logo when booting, you must press F8 and choose among the options of the operating system "Start safe mode"</p>
<p>5. It is important that if you are using Windows 7 or Windows XP, you disable System Restore or the "System Restore".</p>
<p>- Sometimes viruses can hide files in the System Restore, in which case we enable the restoration by turning off the antivirus. This can effectively remove those files. Note that when disabling System Restore , previous restore points are lost, which means you will not have the option to restore the system to a previous date when the system was working normally.<br />
6. Make a full scan of the computer. This may take some time (depends on how much information you have on your computer for antivirus check). Be patient and give it time to do its work program.</p>
<p>REMOVE TROJAN VIRUS</p>
<p>7. If you see that the virus is giving you trouble when trying to remove it, you will have to run MSCONFIG, and then find what program that loads the operating system startup is also responsible for loading the infected file.</p>
<p>- Here you will find instructions on how to use MSCONFIG.</p>
<p>8. After all viruses have been quarantined or removed , restart the PC, connect to the Internet, and once running Windows, choose "windows Update" to download the updates that are recommended for your computer.</p>
<p>Some tips to keep viruses away from your computer:</p>
<p>1. Do not open attachments that come with an e-mail, unless you're absolutely sure they are not infected. Even emails that you think safe, may contain viruses from people that you know and do not iintend to send you a virus, so stay alert.</p>
<p>2. Stay away from websites of questionable content.</p>
<p>3. Be careful when downloading things using P2P file-sharing programs (Peer to Peer). Always scan files you downloaded before opening.</p>
<p>4. Maintain updated version of Microsoft Windows through Windows Update.</p>
<p>5. Keep your antivirus updated and make periodic scans.</p>
<p>6. Install a firewall (or firewalls). The firewall is a security device that works across networks, allowing or denying transmissions from one network to another.</p>
<p>7. Do not install any software unless you know who the manufacturer is. When in doubt, look for the program name on Google.</p>
<p>8. If you have internet explorer as your browser, Change Internet Explorer, to some other browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox</p>
