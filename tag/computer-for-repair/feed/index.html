                <![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">The worst of the worst has happened, and you’re left with a broken computer.</h1>
<p>Situations like these can be extremely stressful, and you’re already frantically typing “<a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair-near-me/">computer repair near m</a>e” into your phone.</p>
<p>Luckily, we’ve compiled some of the best tips to assess potential businesses for proper computer repair. It’s important that you think carefully about your service provider ahead of time to ensure that your device is in the best hands possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1550" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-300x200.png" alt="Computer Support Technician" width="595" height="396" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-768x512.png 768w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-1024x683.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>1. What Services Do You Need?</h2>
<p>Before seeking out proper computer repair, you’ll want to determine precisely what services you need. For example, if you’ve done proper troubleshooting beforehand, you’re not going to have to pay for basic data backup or file transfers.</p>
<p>If you have the time, try to use the internet to determine exactly what the issue is. A quick Google search of your device’s symptoms can bring you to a bevy of helpful online forums that may or may not lead you closer to a solution.</p>
<p>Plus, a good search can help you eliminate any causes that do not seem plausible. Therefore, you’ll have more information to give your prospective technician, saving you time and money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Does this Business Receive Good Reviews?</h2>
<p>While reviews aren’t everything, they can certainly give you a better idea of a prospective repair company’s quality of service. It also doesn’t take a whole lot of extra time to look up reviews online, but it could save you a lot of hassle in the long run.</p>
<p>For the best results, look for crowd-sourced review sites. Most of these sites do not allow the companies themselves to leave reviews, making them a great unbiased source. Try to cross-reference a couple of sites just to be safe.</p>
<p>In addition, pay special attention to any mentioning of good customer service. This is a hugely important factor for reasons we’ll discuss later on, but regardless, keep an eye out for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Any Onsite Options?</h2>
<p>Many repair places nowadays offer onsite repairs which can be super convenient and time-saving. However, oftentimes, this service comes at an extra cost. If you need someone to come to you, budget accordingly.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure of whether or not your potential service provider offers onsite service, go ahead and give them a call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. What Can You Do On Your Own?</h2>
<p>Before calling any repair place, research on how to do some basic troubleshooting from home. This can involve backing up data appropriately or simply using the task manager to help diagnose your computer’s issue.</p>
<p>While troubleshooting may not be your strong suit, it’s certainly an important skill to develop. Plus, backing up data alone preemptively can save you money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. How Is Their Customer Service?</h3>
<p>Possibly the most important factor to pay attention to is how your prospective repair company prioritizes customer service. Any respectable service provider knows that customer care should be at the top of the list, so don’t settle for mediocre technicians.</p>
<p>Technicians who genuinely care about their customers are much more likely to provide quality service since they have more skin in the game. They’re also more likely to go above and beyond to make sure that you’re 100% satisfied with your service.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure exactly how a service provider will perform, give them a preemptive call and see how they respond to your questions. Should they be anything less than friendly and informative, seek help elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. What Are Their Pricing Options?</h3>
<p>Before calling any prospective repair companies, decide upon a reasonable budget. Remember, just because you’re inquiring about a service, doesn’t mean you don’t have any bargaining power. If you need a reference point while creating your budget, look on a couple of company websites. A lot of times, there will be set price point menus to give you a better idea of where to start.</p>
<p>Once you have your budget, call your prospective repair technician and relay your budget. See if their willing to work with you on any price cuts. In addition, sometimes you can get a price break from a referral bonus.</p>
<p>If you can, ask your friends and family for any local recommendations. Should they have any specific companies or technicians they work with, make sure to mention their names when you have your initial consultation. If you don’t get a price break, at least you’ll get an extra layer of accountability ensuring top-notch service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Who Can You Ask For Help?</h3>
<p>If you haven’t already, ask friends, family, or anyone you can think of for service recommendations. Talking to someone during a stressful time can be cathartic, regardless of the subject, plus, they can certainly point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Try to ask for specific names of technicians in order to boost your chances of getting a referral bonus.</p>
<h3>8. What Questions Have You Prepared?</h3>
<p>Before making your initial call to a potential computer service company, you’re going to want to have a list of questions prepared for the best possible service results.</p>
<p>In addition to getting you your needed information, asking questions will help you discern whether or not a service provider is up to a high standard. Pay attention to how the technician approaches answering your questions.</p>
<p>Do they answer thoroughly and politely? Or do they struggle to provide proper answers? Testing a company’s upfront knowledge is a great way to gauge their future quality of service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Only Settle For the Best</h3>
<p>Finding a proper computer repair place isn’t easy by any means, but it is certainly achievable. Just remember the next time you’re looking up “computer repair near me”, you’re following these sound tips to find the best service advice possible.</p>
