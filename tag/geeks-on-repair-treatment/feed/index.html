<p>Shriner's Hospital for Children specializes in pediatric and medical help for children who have suffered and are suffering serious burns and other life-threatening medical conditions, but who have parents that can not afford the specialized help these babies need.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">We believe in protecting and helping little ones</h2>
<p>And we know that not all parents are able to afford medical care for their children, and so we are dedicated to making the world a better place by protecting and taking care of what's most precious in this world;...kids.<a><img class="size-medium wp-image-2250 alignleft" alt="shriners children hospital-page-001 (2)" width="300" height="218" /></a></p>
