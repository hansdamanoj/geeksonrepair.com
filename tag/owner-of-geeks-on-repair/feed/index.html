                <![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone... I created Geeks Connect and called it Geeks Connect with the idea of " We are many Geeks, on a single repair at any given time"<br />
What I mean by this is my vision is that 2 or 4 Geeks working on 1 customer computer problem is better than just 1. So the service you get from beginning to end has you dealing with more than one tech, first on chat or over the phone, and then over the phone, and finally onsite. When onsite, tech has access to our entire team of Geeks, via group messaging from his cell phone should he run into any obstacles dealing with customer problems when on site. We charge a tad bit more than our competitors, but the customer gets a better service this way.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Our competitors all ask customers for billing info and payment upfront, we don't.</h1>
<p>We only ask for payment after work is done, and then after asking the customer to check work performed.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">If you want to hear what our customers have to say about us over the last 10 years</h2>
<p>Just go to our websites "TESTIMONIALS" page right here on Geeks Connect website, and in it, you will find many phone call recordings of our many happy customers, and their raving about how much they love our service and why.<br />
I came up with the idea of recording my customers ( always asking their permission to use recording at the end of the call) when following up with them about our service since my competitors will pay companies to write many FAKE testimonials on their behalf... I thought, what better than the public to hear it directly from my customer's mouth. Here is the link to Geeks Connect "Testimonials page", so you can hear for yourself. Mind you, its limited how many recordings we can upload, we've had thousands upon thousands of happy customers over the years. Here are a few for you to listen to:</p>
