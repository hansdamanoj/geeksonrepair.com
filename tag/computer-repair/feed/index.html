                <![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">The worst of the worst has happened, and you’re left with a broken computer.</h1>
<p>Situations like these can be extremely stressful, and you’re already frantically typing “<a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair-near-me/">computer repair near m</a>e” into your phone.</p>
<p>Luckily, we’ve compiled some of the best tips to assess potential businesses for proper computer repair. It’s important that you think carefully about your service provider ahead of time to ensure that your device is in the best hands possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1550" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-300x200.png" alt="Computer Support Technician" width="595" height="396" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-768x512.png 768w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-1-1024x683.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>1. What Services Do You Need?</h2>
<p>Before seeking out proper computer repair, you’ll want to determine precisely what services you need. For example, if you’ve done proper troubleshooting beforehand, you’re not going to have to pay for basic data backup or file transfers.</p>
<p>If you have the time, try to use the internet to determine exactly what the issue is. A quick Google search of your device’s symptoms can bring you to a bevy of helpful online forums that may or may not lead you closer to a solution.</p>
<p>Plus, a good search can help you eliminate any causes that do not seem plausible. Therefore, you’ll have more information to give your prospective technician, saving you time and money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Does this Business Receive Good Reviews?</h2>
<p>While reviews aren’t everything, they can certainly give you a better idea of a prospective repair company’s quality of service. It also doesn’t take a whole lot of extra time to look up reviews online, but it could save you a lot of hassle in the long run.</p>
<p>For the best results, look for crowd-sourced review sites. Most of these sites do not allow the companies themselves to leave reviews, making them a great unbiased source. Try to cross-reference a couple of sites just to be safe.</p>
<p>In addition, pay special attention to any mentioning of good customer service. This is a hugely important factor for reasons we’ll discuss later on, but regardless, keep an eye out for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Any Onsite Options?</h2>
<p>Many repair places nowadays offer onsite repairs which can be super convenient and time-saving. However, oftentimes, this service comes at an extra cost. If you need someone to come to you, budget accordingly.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure of whether or not your potential service provider offers onsite service, go ahead and give them a call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. What Can You Do On Your Own?</h2>
<p>Before calling any repair place, research on how to do some basic troubleshooting from home. This can involve backing up data appropriately or simply using the task manager to help diagnose your computer’s issue.</p>
<p>While troubleshooting may not be your strong suit, it’s certainly an important skill to develop. Plus, backing up data alone preemptively can save you money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. How Is Their Customer Service?</h3>
<p>Possibly the most important factor to pay attention to is how your prospective repair company prioritizes customer service. Any respectable service provider knows that customer care should be at the top of the list, so don’t settle for mediocre technicians.</p>
<p>Technicians who genuinely care about their customers are much more likely to provide quality service since they have more skin in the game. They’re also more likely to go above and beyond to make sure that you’re 100% satisfied with your service.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure exactly how a service provider will perform, give them a preemptive call and see how they respond to your questions. Should they be anything less than friendly and informative, seek help elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. What Are Their Pricing Options?</h3>
<p>Before calling any prospective repair companies, decide upon a reasonable budget. Remember, just because you’re inquiring about a service, doesn’t mean you don’t have any bargaining power. If you need a reference point while creating your budget, look on a couple of company websites. A lot of times, there will be set price point menus to give you a better idea of where to start.</p>
<p>Once you have your budget, call your prospective repair technician and relay your budget. See if their willing to work with you on any price cuts. In addition, sometimes you can get a price break from a referral bonus.</p>
<p>If you can, ask your friends and family for any local recommendations. Should they have any specific companies or technicians they work with, make sure to mention their names when you have your initial consultation. If you don’t get a price break, at least you’ll get an extra layer of accountability ensuring top-notch service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Who Can You Ask For Help?</h3>
<p>If you haven’t already, ask friends, family, or anyone you can think of for service recommendations. Talking to someone during a stressful time can be cathartic, regardless of the subject, plus, they can certainly point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Try to ask for specific names of technicians in order to boost your chances of getting a referral bonus.</p>
<h3>8. What Questions Have You Prepared?</h3>
<p>Before making your initial call to a potential computer service company, you’re going to want to have a list of questions prepared for the best possible service results.</p>
<p>In addition to getting you your needed information, asking questions will help you discern whether or not a service provider is up to a high standard. Pay attention to how the technician approaches answering your questions.</p>
<p>Do they answer thoroughly and politely? Or do they struggle to provide proper answers? Testing a company’s upfront knowledge is a great way to gauge their future quality of service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Only Settle For the Best</h3>
<p>Finding a proper computer repair place isn’t easy by any means, but it is certainly achievable. Just remember the next time you’re looking up “computer repair near me”, you’re following these sound tips to find the best service advice possible.</p>
<p>Remember, you never have to settle for mediocre service. Great computer repair technicians are out there, you just have to know how and where to look.</p>

<p>With limited time on your hands, it’s even more difficult. Luckily, we’ve compiled 6 of the best tips to get your computer back in tip-top shape</p>
<p>Sit back, relax, and see what our experts recommend for finding the best computer repair company possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1514" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-200x300.png" alt="Local Computer Repair" width="310" height="465" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-200x300.png 200w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-768x1152.png 768w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-683x1024.png 683w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></a></p>
<h2>Consider Your Travel Preferences</h2>
<p>Before seeking out any computer repair company, it’s important to define exactly what local means for you. Ultimately, the further you’re willing to travel, the more leverage you have a customer.</p>
<p>For example, you’re able to comparatively shop and compare the price points of more potential repair companies. You’ll also be able to compare the quality of customer service from shop to shop. As you’ll see later, customer service is one of the best ways to determine the quality of overall care you’ll be receiving.</p>
<p>Look out for any companies that offer <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/contact-us/">door to door</a> service. Though it’s natural to think that these services may be more expensive, they can actually be quite comparable prices. Not to mention, the time saved in traveling and transporting your device may make any extra stipend worth it.</p>
<p>While door to door service certainly isn’t the way to go for everyone, it’s certainly a great option to consider if you have that luxury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Finding the Perfect Technician</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of finding proper computer repair is locating an experienced technician.</p>
<p>Before you give potential companies a preliminary call, try to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with your device. Though this may seem like a no-brainer, you’d be surprised at what a couple of basic troubleshooting tricks may solve.</p>
<p>If you have the chance, do some basic troubleshooting on your computer. Of course, you want to make sure you backup any precious files before starting this process.</p>
<p>Taking the time to do some simple troubleshooting can end up saving you a lot of valuable time and money.</p>
<p>If it’s clear your computer has some sort of hardware issue, opt to back up your files instead and contact a repair company as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Ask the repair company if they have any technicians with specialized services for your computer’s needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What does Your Budget Look Like?</h3>
<p>There’s no denying that computer repair can get costly very quickly. This is another reason why troubleshooting with what you can beforehand is so important.</p>
<p>Write out all the possible repairs you suspect your computer may need and try to look around to see where you can get the best price package for these services.</p>
<p>Some repair company websites freely list out the cost of these services, so you may find all the information you need is only a couple of clicks away.</p>
<p>Depending on the company, your repair service may be able to negotiate the price to fit within your budget. The more information you have regarding costs preemptively, the better chance you have of finding affordable care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Quality of Customer Service</h3>
<p>One of the most telling characteristics of a proper computer repair company is the quality of customer service.</p>
<p>Try to seek out recent reviews for your potential providers to get a glimpse into how they treat their customers. Companies who care about the customer are more likely to care about your computer.</p>
<p>A good way to test this is by calling a number of potential service companies preemptively. Before even asking about specific computer repair services, pay attention to how the technician is responding.</p>
<p>Are they greeting you politely? Guiding you towards proper services? These may seem like little things, but good customer service is excellent from start to finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reading Up on Your Device</h3>
<p>The more you know about your computer beforehand, the better. The technician will need to know both the model and make of your computer, so make sure you have that information readily available.</p>
<p>Moreover, it will also be helpful to know your device’s specialized serial number. You can usually find this on the backside of your computer or laptop, or in the device’s original packaging.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you registered your computer for its included warranty via the manufacturer’s website. If this is the case, log in to the home site of your computer and see if any of your need repairs are included within the included warranty.</p>
<p>If not, try to just look up your model of computer on the website. They’ll have more spec and detailed information available that may be useful for your technician when it comes time to repair your device.</p>
<p>Most manufacturers also have some sort of hotline or online chatroom you can utilize should you be having any serious issues. It may be worth giving them a call before seeking out any sort of computer repairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reach Out For Help</h3>
<p>A damaged computer can make anyone overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help! Whether you need a skilled friend or family member to troubleshoot your computer for you, or just some guidance while backing up your files, asking for assistance is always a great option.</p>
<p>While your immediate friends and family may not be able to help you directly, they may be able to point you to someone who can.</p>
<p>Moreover, family and friends can be a great source of trusted recommendations. Ask around to see if anyone knows any <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair/">local computer repair</a> companies in your area.</p>
<p>Try to get specific names of technicians, if possible. Some companies have referral bonuses, so it may be a win-win for both you and your friend.</p>
<p>Finding quality computer repair can certainly be a hassle, but it doesn’t have to be. With a little extra research and patience, you’re sure to find local repair services perfect for your needs.</p>

                <![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">There’s nothing worse than having a damaged laptop or computer.</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a </span>faulty PC is stressful enough on its own, and finding a local computer repair shop you trust can be just as stressful.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your area, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-quality computer repair options may be few and far between, and you may be inclined to settle for less than you’d like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for you, we’ve done our homework and compiled some of the most useful tips for finding the best computer repair services. Stic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">k around to get yo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ur computer the help it needs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1463" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11-300x200.png" alt="Local Computer Repair Services" width="599" height="399" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11-768x512.png 768w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Troubleshoot First</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before seeking out local computer repair services, make sure you actually need them. </span><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/5-troubleshooting-tips-before-going-to-a-computer-repair-shop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubleshooting properly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can surprisingly solve a myriad of computer problems, and potentially save you a lot of time and money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it’s important to take the time to back up your files properly if you’re able to. Some</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer repair shops will take the initiative to do so themselves, but this service is not guaranteed nor is it free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, know when it’s time to take your computer in to see a professional. If you can’t open your operating system at all or access your files whatsoever, it’s best to take your computer in as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Budget</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure before you pick up the phone to call your local computer repair shop you have a set budget in mind. Some companies will take advantage of a frantic, stressed customer as a way to upsell them a service they may not actually need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decide on how soon you need your computer back and what aspects of the computer are most important to you: Are you looking to preserve the hardware body of your device, or is it more important to preserve the files and information you have stored in your computer’s internal memory?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider your budget as well. Sometimes a repair to a computer or laptop can cost more than half of the price of the device itself. What’s your backup plan in case the proposed repair is outside of your means?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How far are you willing to travel? Does your perspective technician provide </span><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-site repairs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or only on-site? Do they offer walk-in appointments? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although details such as these ones may seem largely insignificant, it’s important to get your priorities straight in order to get your computer the most effective support possible. The more details you can give your local computer repair shop, the more likely they are to serve you effectively and efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, thinking ahead can help you to put your mind at ease during this period of intense stress. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Word of Mouth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to find any service, including computer repair, is through word of mouth. Getting recommendations from people you trust can quickly turnover results, and help ensure your computer is fixed properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, try to get a specific name from your family member or friend. When you contact the local computer repair shop, ask for that particular technician and explain you were referred by someone you trust. Using specific names builds credibility, making your potential technician even more motivated to fix your problem properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, some companies offer a referral discount for you or your friend, and sometimes both! It’s a win-win situation, making word of mouth one of the most effective ways to find quality computer repair. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Bigger isn’t always better</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may assume that a larger computer company is the better choice for your computer. Though this could be correct in some scenarios, sometimes larger conglomerates lack personalized care which is exactly what you need when dealing with something as delicate as a computer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, many larger repair service companies are more expensive, simply because of their more well-known personal brand. If possible, try not to look to electronic superstores for repair.  Though some of the staff may be equipped to take on your repair properly, it may take a much longer period of time to get your repaired device back since these employees have so many varied responsibilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re able to, look for a repair shop that specializes in computers. The more the niche, the better: For example, there are some computer repair technicians that will focus solely on Macs and Apple computers. Generally speaking, the more niche a company is, the more likely they are to offer quality service. ‘</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Online reviews </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in a pinch, look for online reviews in Google searches or crowd-sourced sites like </span><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even sites that were originally used just for food reviews, such as </span><a href="http://yelp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yelp.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now offer reviews on local businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these reviews will also include names of specific technicians and associates, making them potentially just as useful as getting a referral through word of mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure before you commit to a service you go to the host website of the computer repair shop to decide whether or not all of the services or you need are included in what they can offer. When in doubt, pick up the phone- Sometimes a quick phone consultation helps you get a sense of exactly what kind of repair quality you’ll be looking at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for<strong> <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/">local computer repair</a> </strong>shop reviews that gush over an establishment’s level of customer service. Generally speaking, companies that invest in a high level of customer care are also the most determined to provide the highest level of service. </span></p>

Our computers are often an extension of ourselves nowadays, and losing that access can understandably cause you to panic.
