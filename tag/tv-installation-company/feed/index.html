										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Picking out a new TV can be exciting.</h1>
<p>If you’re lucky, you’ve scored a black Friday deal and gotten your TV set at a fraction of the regular price. However, now that you have your TV, how do you find a professional TV installation company? And more importantly, how do you find quality service that will protect your initial investment for years to come?</p>
<p>Luckily for you, we’ve done our homework and come up with a couple of tell-tale signs of an excellent installation company. Consider this your checklist for evaluating potential service providers.</p>
<p>With a little extra patience and research, you’ll be sure to find the perfect installation company for your needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1538" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-300x200.png" alt="TV Installation Company" width="651" height="434" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-300x200.png 300w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-768x511.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a></p>
<h2>Qualified Certifications</h2>
<p>Any proper installation company will have a number of certifications authorizing them to work on a variety of products. If your propective company isn’t able to prove their credentials, look elsewhere.</p>
<p>You can also look on the manufacturer’s website of your TV to see authorized service dealers. By doing this, you’re putting in the extra work to ensure you find an excellent installation company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p>If you aren’t receiving great customer service, even during the initial consultation, look for another installation company. You should never have to settle for poor service, and any respectable place of business knows the importance of putting their customers first.</p>
<p>Plus, great customer service is also an indicator of excellent service. The more a company cares about the individual, the more likely they are to put in the effort to properly secure your device. Make excellent customer service a priority of your professional installation company search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Is your prospective installation company neat, clean, and organized? Or do you find them flipping through paper manuals, drowning in unnecessary paper?</p>
<p>Any great company is organized as this speaks to their level of professionalism. Moreover, an organized company is more likely to be on top of their payment structure and will provide reliable service.</p>
<p>You deserve the absolute best so any installation company that is giving you any less in terms of their organization skills is not worth your time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Included Services</h2>
<p>Do you have a smart TV? What devices are you looking to connect to your TV? If you need help connecting other devices in your home, look for installation companies that are well-rounded in service.</p>
<p>Some companies will include connecting devices or organizing cables for example, as part of their service. Make sure you specify desired additional services during your initial consultations with potential installation providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mounting</h2>
<p>When installing your TV, perhaps one of the most important factors to consider is whether or not you’re going to want your TV to the wall. In this case, you’ll need to purchase a TV mount ahead of time that can support the weight and length of your device.</p>
<p>Some companies specialize in wall mounting, so be sure to look out for this handy feature. If you don’t have a mount yet, look for installation companies that provide custom mounts as a part of their service.</p>
<p>These services are likely to be more expensive but can be a great help if you don’t want to take any chances with your wall mount for your new TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A Willingness To Inform</h3>
<p>Come up with a list of questions beforehand to ask your installation company. During your initial consultation, ask your prospective installation vendor your questions.</p>
<p>If they do not answer thoroughly or pass off the questions entirely, they are not worth your time. Any great installation service has a willingness to inform their clientele, not just offer a one-off service.<br />
You should feel super comfortable asking your technician as many questions as you need. If you feel any negative pressure, look somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Local Service</h3>
<p>Local installation service companies are not only more convenient, but they are likely to offer up better service packages than larger tech conglomerates who have a large base of clients they have to appeal to.</p>
<p>Individualized service is almost always superior, and this is something that you’ll only likely find in a smaller service vendor. Don’t be deterred by their potential lack of overall reach. Rather, use the other qualifying factors on this list to determine whether your potential TV technician is well equipped for the task at hand.</p>
<p>Not to mention, local service providers are likely to get you your service faster. As they say, time is money, and this is an important factor to consider while comparing multiple service providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Budget Negotiations</h3>
<p>Your TV is already expensive enough, but what about the installation? To prepare yourself appropriately, look at sample price-lists on prospective service providers’ websites. Next, use that list to construct a reasonable budget for the installation service and/or mounting.</p>
<p>During your initial consultation, see if you can negotiate a lower price with your potential provider if their services are a bit out of your reach. Many respectable companies will offer a discount to first time users, so it’s always a good idea to ask.</p>
<p>Moreover, ask your friends if there are any professional installing services that they’d recommend. Oftentimes, a referral bonus can thin out your bill and save your friend money in the future, for a win-win situation. In any scenario, it doesn’t hurt to ask to get the most bang for your buck. You deserve a company that values you as much as you value your service, so be sure to inquire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Only Settle For Great</h3>
<p>With so many installation vendors out there, you no longer have to settle for mediocre service. Make sure with each and every consultation you’re using this checklist to ensure that your TV is installed properly and securely. A little extra preemptive research goes a long way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a TV installation company, you can trust can prove to be a tricky process. Purchasing a TV requires a lot of upfront investment on its own, so you want to make sure that you’re protected properly throughout the installation process.</p>
<p>In addition, many TVs now connect to a number of different smart devices, and connecting them appropriately can be challenging enough on its own.</p>
<p>Luckily, we’ve compiled 10 different helpful tips to get you the best TV installation possible. With a little extra research, your TV installation is bound to be successful. Be sure to consider these tips carefully in order to get you the best possible results.</p>
<p><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1490" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-200x300.png" alt="TV Installation" width="452" height="678" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-200x300.png 200w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-768x1152.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-683x1024.png 683w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.png 934w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Know Your TV Beforehand</h2>
<p>One of the best ways you can prepare yourself is to know your TV inside and out before seeking out an efficient installation company. If you’re hoping to connect a number of devices to your TV, be sure you have the appropriate cables and connectors so there’s no hassle during your installation appointment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the more time you spend proactively planning, the less time and money you’ll have to spend finding an adequate Television installation company. If you’re armed with questions specific to your device, you’ll be able to discern quickly whether or not a prospective company is right for the job.</p>
<h2>2. Customer Service</h2>
<p>Customer service is a huge indicator of a Television installation company’s level of service. In order to have the best installation possible, make sure you seek out companies that make customer care a priority.</p>
<p>Not only will this make the installation process sooner, but should you have any issues in the weeks following your installation, the company is more likely to lend a helping hand. If nothing else, be sure to give prospective companies a call before ordering their services. If you’re receiving great customer care over the phone, it’s likely they will remain consistent during your in-person appointment.</p>
<h2>3. Comparatively Shop</h2>
<p>Remember that you are not limited to checking out a single installation company. Make sure you check out your full range of options by visiting different TV installation locations or making several initial calls. Don’t forget that the time you spend now will save you time later.</p>
<h2>4. Consider Your Mount</h2>
<p>Some TV installation companies specialize in certain types of mounts. Make sure you scour each prospective company’s website to see if they have experience with your particular type of mount.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll find packages that include a custom mount built specifically for your TV. If this is of interest to you, make sure to budget a little extra cash as these plans are oftentimes more expensive than other comparable plans.</p>
<h2>5. Consider Any Extras</h2>
<p>Your future <a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/client-testimonials/">TV installation company</a> can do more than simply mount and set up your TV. For example, some offer to sync your TV to external surround sound or speaker audio. Moreover, companies can also aid in connecting your smart devices with your TV or with cable management.</p>
<p>Be sure to look out for these extras when considering installation services. They are likely to cost a bit more, but it’s always worth the peace of mind of having a full setup completed by a professional.</p>
<p><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.png"><img class=" wp-image-1491 aligncenter" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-225x300.png" alt="" width="447" height="596" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-225x300.png 225w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-768x1024.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Cable Organization</h2>
<p>In order to ensure the most efficient installation appointment possible, try to plan out exactly where your power sources will be in relation to your TV mount. You may find a company that provides this service as an add-on, but it’s always a good idea to have a clear plan in mind beforehand regardless of your situation.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to organize your cables following the TV installation, look out for cable ties or other helpful organizational tools. The more simplified your entertainment station is, the better.</p>
<h2>7. Take Proper Measurements of Your Space</h2>
<p>Before calling a prospective TV company, take measurements of your TV as well as the distance between your mount and the ground and other adjacent walls. These measurements can help your installation professional be as efficient as possible and will ensure that they have the needed tools to keep your TV secure.</p>
<p>Be sure to record these measurements on your phone or on a notepad to reference during your initial consultation with your installer.</p>
<h2>8. Included Warranty</h2>
<p>Hopefully, your installation company will ensure that your TV is secure and not liable to future damage, but you may want to look into seeking out a company with an added or included warranty just to be safe.</p>
<p>Regardless of the level of customer care and service, accidents do happen, so it’s important you weigh in carefully upon whether or not a TV installation warranty is worth it for you. Sometimes these warranties will include coverage for future mounting, or even repair to the TV should it become damaged due to faulty or worn down installation.</p>
<h2>9. Come up with Questions</h2>
<p>Along with the needed measurements, specifications, and compatibilities specific to your device come up with preemptive questions to ask your potential television installation company via the phone or during your in-person consultation.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to ask a lot of questions- These professionals are trained to make you feel comfortable and secure about your TV installation, so be vocal with any concerns you may have.</p>
<p>If anything, this will help your installation professional cater their service more effectively to your needs.</p>
<h2>10. Ask for Recommendations</h2>
<p>If all else fails, ask your family members and friends for recommendations regarding a trustworthy company. The process can certainly be nervewracking, so don’t be afraid to reach out for guidance.</p>
<p>Finding a suitable company can certainly be stressful, but it doesn’t have to be. As long as you are following these 10 simple tips, you’re sure to find services you can count on.</p>
