<p>I was looking for Computer Repair Near Me, but also a company that can put together and successfully completes a Home Theater Installation.<br />
I found Geeks Connect.</p>
<p>The technician who arrived taught me how to Set Up My Wifi, and also How To Make My Computer Faster. I told the tech about how My Computer Is Always Becoming Slow and how many anti-virus programs I've used in the past simply do not work in the long run.<br />
So the tech performed <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/remove-trojan-virus/">Computer Virus Removal</a> on my computer and then taught me how to not keep getting more viruses in the future. Lastly, I signed up for their unlimited yearly service plan, where I can call them anytime to get them connected to my computer as much as I need.</p>
<p>They are not only the best techs when it comes to Geeks On-Site computer repair, but they are also the best Online Computer Repair techs !!</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">They are undoubtedly the best! I can't say it enough because they truly are.</h2>
