                <![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Picking out a new TV can be exciting.</h1>
<p>If you’re lucky, you’ve scored a black Friday deal and gotten your TV set at a fraction of the regular price. However, now that you have your TV, how do you find a professional TV installation company? And more importantly, how do you find quality service that will protect your initial investment for years to come?</p>
<p>Luckily for you, we’ve done our homework and come up with a couple of tell-tale signs of an excellent installation company. Consider this your checklist for evaluating potential service providers.</p>
<p>With a little extra patience and research, you’ll be sure to find the perfect installation company for your needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1538" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-300x200.png" alt="TV Installation Company" width="651" height="434" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-768x511.png 768w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a></p>
<h2>Qualified Certifications</h2>
<p>Any proper installation company will have a number of certifications authorizing them to work on a variety of products. If your propective company isn’t able to prove their credentials, look elsewhere.</p>
<p>You can also look on the manufacturer’s website of your TV to see authorized service dealers. By doing this, you’re putting in the extra work to ensure you find an excellent installation company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p>If you aren’t receiving great customer service, even during the initial consultation, look for another installation company. You should never have to settle for poor service, and any respectable place of business knows the importance of putting their customers first.</p>
<p>Plus, great customer service is also an indicator of excellent service. The more a company cares about the individual, the more likely they are to put in the effort to properly secure your device. Make excellent customer service a priority of your professional installation company search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Is your prospective installation company neat, clean, and organized? Or do you find them flipping through paper manuals, drowning in unnecessary paper?</p>
<p>Any great company is organized as this speaks to their level of professionalism. Moreover, an organized company is more likely to be on top of their payment structure and will provide reliable service.</p>
<p>You deserve the absolute best so any installation company that is giving you any less in terms of their organization skills is not worth your time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Included Services</h2>
<p>Do you have a smart TV? What devices are you looking to connect to your TV? If you need help connecting other devices in your home, look for installation companies that are well-rounded in service.</p>
<p>Some companies will include connecting devices or organizing cables for example, as part of their service. Make sure you specify desired additional services during your initial consultations with potential installation providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mounting</h2>
<p>When installing your TV, perhaps one of the most important factors to consider is whether or not you’re going to want your TV to the wall. In this case, you’ll need to purchase a TV mount ahead of time that can support the weight and length of your device.</p>
<p>Some companies specialize in wall mounting, so be sure to look out for this handy feature. If you don’t have a mount yet, look for installation companies that provide custom mounts as a part of their service.</p>
<p>These services are likely to be more expensive but can be a great help if you don’t want to take any chances with your wall mount for your new TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A Willingness To Inform</h3>
<p>Come up with a list of questions beforehand to ask your installation company. During your initial consultation, ask your prospective installation vendor your questions.</p>
<p>If they do not answer thoroughly or pass off the questions entirely, they are not worth your time. Any great installation service has a willingness to inform their clientele, not just offer a one-off service.<br />
You should feel super comfortable asking your technician as many questions as you need. If you feel any negative pressure, look somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Local Service</h3>
<p>Local installation service companies are not only more convenient, but they are likely to offer up better service packages than larger tech conglomerates who have a large base of clients they have to appeal to.</p>
<p>Individualized service is almost always superior, and this is something that you’ll only likely find in a smaller service vendor. Don’t be deterred by their potential lack of overall reach. Rather, use the other qualifying factors on this list to determine whether your potential TV technician is well equipped for the task at hand.</p>
<p>Not to mention, local service providers are likely to get you your service faster. As they say, time is money, and this is an important factor to consider while comparing multiple service providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Budget Negotiations</h3>
<p>Your TV is already expensive enough, but what about the installation? To prepare yourself appropriately, look at sample price-lists on prospective service providers’ websites. Next, use that list to construct a reasonable budget for the installation service and/or mounting.</p>
<p>During your initial consultation, see if you can negotiate a lower price with your potential provider if their services are a bit out of your reach. Many respectable companies will offer a discount to first time users, so it’s always a good idea to ask.</p>
<p>Moreover, ask your friends if there are any professional installing services that they’d recommend. Oftentimes, a referral bonus can thin out your bill and save your friend money in the future, for a win-win situation. In any scenario, it doesn’t hurt to ask to get the most bang for your buck. You deserve a company that values you as much as you value your service, so be sure to inquire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Only Settle For Great</h3>
<p>With so many installation vendors out there, you no longer have to settle for mediocre service. Make sure with each and every consultation you’re using this checklist to ensure that your TV is installed properly and securely. A little extra preemptive research goes a long way.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>You’ve finally got the TV of your dreams, and you couldn’t be more excited to enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows with your family and friends. There’s just one problem…</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 35px;">The TV has yet to be installed, and you have no idea where to start.</h1>
<p>Luckily for you, we’ve compiled some of the best tips to find the best local TV installers in your area for a hassle-free experience. The cost of your TV is a huge financial investment of its own, so you never want to skimp out on proper installation.</p>
<p>In a way, TV installation services are kind of a form of insurance for your TV: If you choose to get proper services now to ensure your TV is properly installed, it’s more likely to last longer and be used with care.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here is our expert advice for finding the best local TV installers near you.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1524" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1-300x200.png" alt="Professional TV Installers" width="536" height="358" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-1-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Use Crowd-Sourced Reviews</h2>
<p>In addition to using all the available information on the company’s website, make sure you seek out crowd-sourced reviews. This will allow you to get a clear picture of what to expect from your potential installation company.</p>
<p>Many crowd-sourced review sites like angieslist.com and trustpiolit.com do their best to only display the reviews of verified service users. Therefore, a quick preemptive search could save you a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Ask Family Members and Friends For Advice</h2>
<p>Make sure to reach out to those you trust the most for reliable TV installation recommendations. Your family members probably have a good idea of what services would work best for your specific needs.</p>
<p>Plus, getting a specific name or company referral from someone you trust keeps the installation company as accountable as possible. You may feel uncomfortable bothering your family members for advice, but don’t be. Instead, be sure to offer up your own solid service recommendations in the future.</p>
<p>That way, you can build your network together in the most efficient and effective way possible. It’s likely that someone in your personal sphere has required a TV installation at some point in time, so take advantage of their pasts knowledge and experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Know Your TV Beforehand</h2>
<p>One of the best ways you can prepare for <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair/">local TV installers</a> is by knowing your device inside and out. It’s likely that your installation company will have questions regarding your TV during your initial consultation, so prepare yourself accordingly.</p>
<p>What specific make and model of TV do you have? Is it covered by a manufacturer’s warranty? Are there any smart devices you’re looking to connect to your TV? All of this information can be found via your manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>Have your serial and product number ready by checking the original packaging or the backside of your device. The more information you can gather preemptively, the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Comparatively Shop</h2>
<p>If you have the time to do so, don’t settle on the first TV installation company you come across. Instead, comparatively shop across a couple of potential service providers.</p>
<p>Try to consider important factors like budget, customer service, and overall ease of access. You’ll find that some companies even have a price match guarantee for quotes by their competitors, so don’t be afraid to negotiate when it’s time to set pricing.</p>
<p>As a valued customer, you deserve to be treated with kindness and care. Don’t settle for any business that treats you like anything less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Have Your Mount Ready</h2>
<p>One of the most important factors to consider when getting your TV installed is the mount itself. For example, if you’re mounting your TV v.s onto a dresser, your technician will approach your service package completely differently.</p>
<p>Map out exactly where you want your TV, and double-check to ensure that your mount will be able to support your device’s weight at any particular angle. If you don’t have a mount yet, look for services who offer custom mounts as a part of their service package.</p>
<p>While this will likely make for an added expense, you’ll be getting the valuable peace of mind knowing that your mount was expertly crafted by an experienced professional.</p>
<p>Also consider cable management options, especially if you have children or pets at home. While added cables can make proper TV installation more of a challenge, your TV technician should have the chops necessary to make this process a breeze.</p>
<p>Ask about your potential company’s expertise with cable management during your initial call to make this feature a priority. With clear and proper communication, you’re bound to get the best TV installation experience possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Look For Local TV Installation Services</h2>
<p>If at all possible, look for local TV installation companies. Not only will this save you time and effort, but oftentimes smaller, brick-and-mortar companies are able to offer more specialized service.</p>
<p>Large conglomerates may have more familiar names and a variety of reviews, but they aren’t able to offer the individualized care that comes from smaller based installers.</p>
<p>Plus, the less a technician has to travel, the more likely it is that you’ll be offered more affordable services. Remember, travel costs are part of what you’re paying when you order installation services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Referral Bonuses</h2>
<p>Another great benefit of reach out to family and friends is the possibility of earning a referral bonus for either you or your close friend. Plenty of installation companies, particularly local, are happy to offer discounted services and special features to loyal customers willing to refer more clients.</p>
<p>Take advantage of this benefit and scope out any potential services within your personal sphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Find Proper TV Installation Effectively</h2>
<p>Finding a reputable service provider can be tricky, but it doesn’t have to be. Hopefully, some of these tips gave you more of a well-rounded strategy for finding TV installation services without a whole lot of extra hassle.</p>
