<p>YELP has some issue with allowing new users to post publicly on their YELP reviews page and  website , subsequently some of our customers went to YELP to post about us , and YELP decided to not publish their posts.</p>
<p>We think this is wrong , since these are actual customers of ours that took the time to write about their experience with us, and weren't allowed to share their experience.</p>
<p>So we have taken it upon ourselves to take snapshots of our customers comments on YELP and post their comments here on our website.</p>
<p>Were not like other computer repair companies that create false testimonials or customer posts, everything with us and about us is genuine.</p>
<h2 style=font-size:20px;>Click on the snap shot pictures above to read what they had to say about us!</h2>
