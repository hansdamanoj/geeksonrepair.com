										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one expects their trusted computer to break down, but when it happens, it can be devastating. Worst of all, unexpected computer repair can burn a hole in your budget that you weren’t prepared for.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">If you find yourself in this tricky situation</h1>
<p>The only thing you can do is seek out an affordable computer repair shop. However, with so many services out on the market, it can be difficult to determine which businesses will offer the best value.</p>
<p>Luckily, we’ve compiled 7 helpful considerations to aid you in your search. The next time you frantically type, “Computer Repair Near Me” into your phone, try out these tips to get your computer repaired as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44.png"><img class=" wp-image-1508 aligncenter" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44-300x200.png" alt="" width="605" height="404" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44-300x200.png 300w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44-768x512.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44-1024x683.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What are your needs?</h2>
<p>Before seeking out computer repair services of any kind, determine exactly what you need from your service provider. If at all possible, try out these<a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/5-troubleshooting-tips-before-going-to-a-computer-repair-shop/"> 5 troubleshooting tips</a> beforehand. Taking the time to troubleshoot thoroughly on your own can potentially save you time and money in the long run, so it’s definitely worth a try.</p>
<p>If you’ve already gone through the troubleshooting process thoroughly, make a list of the specific or suspected issues of your device. This will help your future technician direct your service and also serve as a way to hold your service provider accountable for noticeable improvements in your device’s performance.</p>
<p>Categorize your needed repairs into hardware and software issues, if applicable. How a technician approaches a technical error will be very different from how they solve physical problems with the computer’s parts. Make sure you hold on to the list and utilize it during your initial consultation.</p>
<h2>Do you have Any Included Warranties?</h2>
<p>Before seeking out “<a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/computer-repair-near-me/">computer repair near me</a>”, make sure you read up all you possibly can on your computer. This includes seeking out any included or purchased warranties. Should you have either of these, be sure to check if your potential service provider partners with the specific brand of your device.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you’ve purchased your device within the past 90 days, it’s likely you have a courtesy coverage or return plan available from the site of purchase. If this is the case, make sure you take advantage of your plan accordingly.</p>
<p>If you’re ever unsure, you should be able to look up your specific device via the manufacturer’s website. As long as you’ve registered your device properly, you should be able to look up any related warranty information by using your computer’s serial number. This can be found by looking at the backside of your computer or on the inside of the original packaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Consider your Budget</h2>
<p>Though many of these repairs occur unexpectedly, it’s important that you seek out computer repair services that don’t leave you in significant debt. Using your list of expected repairs, try to gain a rough estimate of overall costs. Though it may be somewhat stressful to look at the total cost of repairs in one sitting, it’s a necessary part of the process that will serve you better in the long run.</p>
<p>If you’re still stressed out about the cost, see if any of your available options offer installment or payment plans over a couple of months. Though these plans often end up costing more in the long run, it may be worth the extra money to gradually pay off your repairs overtime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Consider your location</h2>
<p>Our computers are essential parts of our lives so naturally, you want to get your device up and running as soon as possible. Seek out local computer repair in order to give you the most efficient results possible.</p>
<p>More often than not, certain companies now offer to come directly to you. In which case, you can have your computer repaired from the comfort of your home. If this is of interest, you may have to budget a bit more financially for this point of convenience.</p>
<p>Also, consider the availability of your service provider. It may be worth it to drive a bit further out if it means getting an appointment sooner.</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>A great indicator of quality computer repair is quality customer service. If you’re having trouble picking between computer repair service providers, look for online testimonials regarding their level of customer care.</p>
<p>The more a company cares about the customer, the more likely you are to have a successful computer repair experience. If there isn’t enough information online regarding your potential provider, feel free to give them a preemptive call.</p>
<p>How a company represents themselves over the phone is often indicative of how they act in real life. Therefore, an initial call may save you time and money in the long run.</p>
<h3>Comparatively Shop</h3>
<p>Desperately needing urgent computer repair can be stressful for sure, but make sure you don’t allow this aspect to cloud your judgment. Try not to settle for the first computer repair service company you come across though you may be tempted to do so.</p>
<p>Your power rests in your ability to comparatively shop between services. Be sure to compare pricing, quality of customer service, provider availability, and proximity to your home. The perfect computer repair service provider for you does it exist, you just have to set aside time to find them.</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>When in doubt, seek recommendations from family members or friends. Oftentimes, this is the quickest way to find service of quality without a whole lot of legwork. If possible, see if your potential repair company offers a referral bonus. For example, they may offer discounted services for you and your friend, so it’s a win-win situation!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Affordable Computer Repair is Achievable</h3>
<p>Finding high-quality computer repair can be difficult, but it doesn’t have to be. As long as you’re following these 7 guidelines, you’re sure to find the perfect service provider for you and your family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">There’s nothing worse than having a damaged laptop or computer.</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a </span>faulty PC is stressful enough on its own, and finding a local computer repair shop you trust can be just as stressful.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your area, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-quality computer repair options may be few and far between, and you may be inclined to settle for less than you’d like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for you, we’ve done our homework and compiled some of the most useful tips for finding the best computer repair services. Stic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">k around to get yo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ur computer the help it needs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1463" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11-300x200.png" alt="Local Computer Repair Services" width="599" height="399" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11-300x200.png 300w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11-768x512.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/11.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Troubleshoot First</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before seeking out local computer repair services, make sure you actually need them. </span><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/5-troubleshooting-tips-before-going-to-a-computer-repair-shop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubleshooting properly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can surprisingly solve a myriad of computer problems, and potentially save you a lot of time and money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it’s important to take the time to back up your files properly if you’re able to. Some</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer repair shops will take the initiative to do so themselves, but this service is not guaranteed nor is it free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, know when it’s time to take your computer in to see a professional. If you can’t open your operating system at all or access your files whatsoever, it’s best to take your computer in as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Budget</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure before you pick up the phone to call your local computer repair shop you have a set budget in mind. Some companies will take advantage of a frantic, stressed customer as a way to upsell them a service they may not actually need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decide on how soon you need your computer back and what aspects of the computer are most important to you: Are you looking to preserve the hardware body of your device, or is it more important to preserve the files and information you have stored in your computer’s internal memory?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider your budget as well. Sometimes a repair to a computer or laptop can cost more than half of the price of the device itself. What’s your backup plan in case the proposed repair is outside of your means?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How far are you willing to travel? Does your perspective technician provide </span><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/computer-repair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-site repairs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or only on-site? Do they offer walk-in appointments? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although details such as these ones may seem largely insignificant, it’s important to get your priorities straight in order to get your computer the most effective support possible. The more details you can give your local computer repair shop, the more likely they are to serve you effectively and efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, thinking ahead can help you to put your mind at ease during this period of intense stress. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/22.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1464" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/22-300x200.png" alt="Computer Network Support Specialists" width="596" height="397" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/22-300x200.png 300w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/22-768x512.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/22.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Word of Mouth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to find any service, including computer repair, is through word of mouth. Getting recommendations from people you trust can quickly turnover results, and help ensure your computer is fixed properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, try to get a specific name from your family member or friend. When you contact the local computer repair shop, ask for that particular technician and explain you were referred by someone you trust. Using specific names builds credibility, making your potential technician even more motivated to fix your problem properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, some companies offer a referral discount for you or your friend, and sometimes both! It’s a win-win situation, making word of mouth one of the most effective ways to find quality computer repair. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Bigger isn’t always better</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may assume that a larger computer company is the better choice for your computer. Though this could be correct in some scenarios, sometimes larger conglomerates lack personalized care which is exactly what you need when dealing with something as delicate as a computer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, many larger repair service companies are more expensive, simply because of their more well-known personal brand. If possible, try not to look to electronic superstores for repair.  Though some of the staff may be equipped to take on your repair properly, it may take a much longer period of time to get your repaired device back since these employees have so many varied responsibilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re able to, look for a repair shop that specializes in computers. The more the niche, the better: For example, there are some computer repair technicians that will focus solely on Macs and Apple computers. Generally speaking, the more niche a company is, the more likely they are to offer quality service. ‘</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Online reviews </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in a pinch, look for online reviews in Google searches or crowd-sourced sites like </span><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even sites that were originally used just for food reviews, such as </span><a href="http://yelp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yelp.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now offer reviews on local businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these reviews will also include names of specific technicians and associates, making them potentially just as useful as getting a referral through word of mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure before you commit to a service you go to the host website of the computer repair shop to decide whether or not all of the services or you need are included in what they can offer. When in doubt, pick up the phone- Sometimes a quick phone consultation helps you get a sense of exactly what kind of repair quality you’ll be looking at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for<strong> <a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/">local computer repair</a> </strong>shop reviews that gush over an establishment’s level of customer service. Generally speaking, companies that invest in a high level of customer care are also the most determined to provide the highest level of service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know first hand that finding a trustworthy computer repair service can be stressful. Our computers are often an extension of ourselves nowadays, and losing that access can understandably cause you to panic. Hopefully, these tips put you on the right path to getting your laptop or PC fixed quickly and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re ever in doubt, we’d be happy to offer you a consultation over the phone by calling  <a href="tel:1-(800) 674-9418">1-(800) 674-9418</a>. </span><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/contact-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geeks On Repair </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is ready to respond to any and all of your repair needs with care.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-1449" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5-300x200.png" alt="Computer Repair Shop" width="437" height="291" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5-300x200.png 300w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5-768x512.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></a>Nowadays, it’s almost impossible to get by without a reliable computer. Laptop and computer problems can be extremely stressful and lead to obstructions in our work and personal lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">If your computer or laptop is acting up, don’t panic.</h1>
<p>Before you frantically type <strong>Computer Repair Near Me</strong> frantically into your cell phone, try out some of these common troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although many of these tips are simple in nature, they could be just what you need to get your computer up and running again so you can at least back up your files before undergoing a more extensive repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1.   Reboot</h2>
<p>Although it may seem fairly obvious, restarting/rebooting your computer is an important part of maintaining your computer’s health. Restarting your computer flushes your RAM which helps your computer run tasks more efficiently by removing the excess temporary data your RAM may be focusing on.</p>
<p>Moreover, restarting your computer helps relinquish any “memory leaks” your computer may have. Some programs and web browsers borrow your computers RAM to run in the background or save preferences/history created during your most recent computer session. If running effectively, these programs will return the borrowed memory when closed, but occasionally outdated programs can result in leaks which can only be restored with a restart of the computer.</p>
<p>Be sure to check for any system updates as well. Large system updates typically require a reboot, which can slow down your device considerably if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Searching for “computer repair near me” is always a good idea, but you should always reboot your computer initially as it will serve as the foundation for any additional repairs anyway. You’d be surprised how much a simple restart can do, and some tech experts recommend making computer restarts a part of your daily routine.</p>
<h2>2.   Check Task Manager and run a Virus Scan</h2>
<p>Before checking your computer into a physical repair shop, it’s important to determine whether or not the issue is the computer itself, or particular software or program. You can use the task manager to prevent yourself from scrambling to find a <strong>computer repair near me</strong>.</p>
<p>On Windows, simply press ctrl + alt + delete and select “task manager”. Alternatively, type task manager by clicking the start menu and typing “task manager” into the search bar.</p>
<p>On an Apple Mac, press command + spacebar to open up spotlight search. From here, type in “Activity Monitor”.</p>
<p>Within Task Manager and Activity Monitor, you should be able to see the amount of CPU each application is currently taking up. It can be surprising how many programs will take up CPU even when not in direct use.</p>
<p>To assist your computer, consider quitting these programs or removing them altogether if they are outdated. If you’re unable to exit out of these programs from the application yourself, you should be able to force quit within the task manager or activity monitor by selecting “end task” or selecting the X in the top left-hand corner and selecting “quit” on Macs.</p>
<p>In addition to checking your task manager, try to run your antivirus software and check for any bugs. Malware can take up a considerable amount of data in addition to infecting your computer, and will keep you constantly searching for <strong>computer repair near me</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3.   Use the Power of the Internet</h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/blog/">blog </a>updated weekly has a number of solutions to help solve any issues before having to resort to asking where you can find a “computer repair near me”. In addition to our own site, there are tons of helpful links that can be accessed through a quick Google search.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1450" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-300x200.png" alt="Computer Repair Near Me" width="509" height="340" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-300x200.png 300w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /></p>
<p>In the age of Youtube, you have access to many online tutorials often catered to your particular problem. There are numerous channels dedicated specifically to the upkeep of computers, so taking a quick look is definitely worth your while.</p>
<p>Just remember to save and backup all of your files if possible before troubleshooting your computer. Hopefully, it won’t come to the point where your hard drive is compromised, but it’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Our company also offers immediate onsite support by calling our toll free number 1-(800) 674-9418. If nothing else, we can help guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.   Eliminate Unnecessary Programs</h2>
<p>Before you run to find <strong>computer repair near me</strong> use the process of elimination to your advantage. Try to think about whether or not any of the programs you have installed have caused a drastic change in performance. Even if the changes seemed somewhat small, it’s worth examining whether or not they are worth having on your computer.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, make a habit of removing programs and files that you no longer have a need for. These files can easily rack up over time and slow down your computer’s performance.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure of where to start, open up task manager or activity monitor (See step #2 above) where you have a clear view of all of your programs along with the CPU they’re currently using and how much memory they take up. Start by eliminating larger unnecessary programs first and work your way down.</p>
<p>However simple, eliminating unnecessary programs on your computer on a regular basis can keep you from scrambling to find “computer repair near me”. Just like you maintain your physical health, keeping your computer healthy and clear is also important.</p>

<h2>5.   Reinstall your Operating System</h2>
<p>If you had the chance to backup all your needed files and programs, it can be beneficial to reinstall your operating system before looking for a <a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/computer-repair-near-me/"><strong>computer repair near me</strong></a>. Updated Windows and Macs make it easier than ever before to do so, and it can make a huge difference in your computer’s performance.</p>
<p>For Windows, first, check to make sure that your Microsoft account is linked with your Windows product key. This is important as your Windows preferences are tied with your Microsoft account. Again, double-check to make sure your files are properly secured and backed up on an external drive.</p>
<p>Go to start + settings + Reset this PC. You’ll have the option of whether or not you want to keep your files in place. Programs will automatically be reset.</p>
<p>For Mac, also make sure your files are secure on an external drive. Restart your computer, and press Command + R keys simultaneously until the utility window pops up. Select “reinstall operating system”.</p>
<p>Some computer users swear by doing this at least once a year to keep their computers running efficiently and prevent themselves from having to make the dreaded <strong>computer repair near me</strong> search.</p>
