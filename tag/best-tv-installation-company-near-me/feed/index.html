										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Picking out a new TV can be exciting.</h1>
<p>If you’re lucky, you’ve scored a black Friday deal and gotten your TV set at a fraction of the regular price. However, now that you have your TV, how do you find a professional TV installation company? And more importantly, how do you find quality service that will protect your initial investment for years to come?</p>
<p>Luckily for you, we’ve done our homework and come up with a couple of tell-tale signs of an excellent installation company. Consider this your checklist for evaluating potential service providers.</p>
<p>With a little extra patience and research, you’ll be sure to find the perfect installation company for your needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1538" src="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-300x200.png" alt="TV Installation Company" width="651" height="434" srcset="https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-300x200.png 300w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa-768x511.png 768w, https://geeksonrepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aa.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a></p>
<h2>Qualified Certifications</h2>
<p>Any proper installation company will have a number of certifications authorizing them to work on a variety of products. If your propective company isn’t able to prove their credentials, look elsewhere.</p>
<p>You can also look on the manufacturer’s website of your TV to see authorized service dealers. By doing this, you’re putting in the extra work to ensure you find an excellent installation company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p>If you aren’t receiving great customer service, even during the initial consultation, look for another installation company. You should never have to settle for poor service, and any respectable place of business knows the importance of putting their customers first.</p>
<p>Plus, great customer service is also an indicator of excellent service. The more a company cares about the individual, the more likely they are to put in the effort to properly secure your device. Make excellent customer service a priority of your professional installation company search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Is your prospective installation company neat, clean, and organized? Or do you find them flipping through paper manuals, drowning in unnecessary paper?</p>
<p>Any great company is organized as this speaks to their level of professionalism. Moreover, an organized company is more likely to be on top of their payment structure and will provide reliable service.</p>
<p>You deserve the absolute best so any installation company that is giving you any less in terms of their organization skills is not worth your time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Included Services</h2>
<p>Do you have a smart TV? What devices are you looking to connect to your TV? If you need help connecting other devices in your home, look for installation companies that are well-rounded in service.</p>
<p>Some companies will include connecting devices or organizing cables for example, as part of their service. Make sure you specify desired additional services during your initial consultations with potential installation providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mounting</h2>
<p>When installing your TV, perhaps one of the most important factors to consider is whether or not you’re going to want your TV to the wall. In this case, you’ll need to purchase a TV mount ahead of time that can support the weight and length of your device.</p>
<p>Some companies specialize in wall mounting, so be sure to look out for this handy feature. If you don’t have a mount yet, look for installation companies that provide custom mounts as a part of their service.</p>
<p>These services are likely to be more expensive but can be a great help if you don’t want to take any chances with your wall mount for your new TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A Willingness To Inform</h3>
<p>Come up with a list of questions beforehand to ask your installation company. During your initial consultation, ask your prospective installation vendor your questions.</p>
<p>If they do not answer thoroughly or pass off the questions entirely, they are not worth your time. Any great installation service has a willingness to inform their clientele, not just offer a one-off service.<br />
You should feel super comfortable asking your technician as many questions as you need. If you feel any negative pressure, look somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Local Service</h3>
<p>Local installation service companies are not only more convenient, but they are likely to offer up better service packages than larger tech conglomerates who have a large base of clients they have to appeal to.</p>
<p>Individualized service is almost always superior, and this is something that you’ll only likely find in a smaller service vendor. Don’t be deterred by their potential lack of overall reach. Rather, use the other qualifying factors on this list to determine whether your potential TV technician is well equipped for the task at hand.</p>
<p>Not to mention, local service providers are likely to get you your service faster. As they say, time is money, and this is an important factor to consider while comparing multiple service providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Budget Negotiations</h3>
<p>Your TV is already expensive enough, but what about the installation? To prepare yourself appropriately, look at sample price-lists on prospective service providers’ websites. Next, use that list to construct a reasonable budget for the installation service and/or mounting.</p>
<p>During your initial consultation, see if you can negotiate a lower price with your potential provider if their services are a bit out of your reach. Many respectable companies will offer a discount to first time users, so it’s always a good idea to ask.</p>
<p>Moreover, ask your friends if there are any professional installing services that they’d recommend. Oftentimes, a referral bonus can thin out your bill and save your friend money in the future, for a win-win situation. In any scenario, it doesn’t hurt to ask to get the most bang for your buck. You deserve a company that values you as much as you value your service, so be sure to inquire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Only Settle For Great</h3>
<p>With so many installation vendors out there, you no longer have to settle for mediocre service. Make sure with each and every consultation you’re using this checklist to ensure that your TV is installed properly and securely. A little extra preemptive research goes a long way.</p>
