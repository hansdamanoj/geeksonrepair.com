                <![CDATA[<h1 style=font-size:30px;>Your worst nightmare has come true: </h1>
<p>Your computer has stopped working for one reason or another, and you need a repair fast. However, just because your computer isn’t working doesn’t mean that the world stops turning. You still have plenty on your to-do list and responsibilities to attend to. It seems your only option is to settle for a repair shop nearby.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, we’ve compiled a list of helpful ways to pick out the best local computer repair company possible. With these 10 tips, you’ll get your computer repaired in no time at all without adding extra stress to your life.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-2.png"><img class=" wp-image-1530 aligncenter" src="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-2-300x200.png" alt="" width="649" height="432" srcset="http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-2-300x200.png 300w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-2-768x512.png 768w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-2-1024x683.png 1024w, http://geeksconnect.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-2.png 1950w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Take a Deep Breath</h2>
<p>There’s no denying that a broken computer can be stressful, to say the least, but try your best to take a deep breath. Stress can cloud your focus and make it more difficult to find a suitable repair facility. Know that eventually your computer will be repaired or replaced, and you’ll be able to resume with regular life very soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Phone a Friend</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to relieve stress and hear about nearby computer repair shops is to call beloved friends and family members. Tell your friend about your computer, and see if they have any helpful recommendations. Should they have a computer repair place in mind, ask to see if they worked with a particular technician.</p>
<p>Sometimes, computer repair shops will offer referral bonuses to their customers allowing the new and old client to both get a discount. You could end up saving money for both you and your friend. Make sure you ask your friend about the customer service of the prospective repair company. It’s likely that well-treated customers also receive well-treated computers, so make this factor a priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Read Online Reviews</h2>
<p>If you don’t have the time to call up a friend or if your search is fruitless, check out online reviews for a couple of prospective companies. Make sure you use crowd-sourced review sites like Trustpilot or others to ensure that you’re receiving unbiased accounts.</p>
<p>Just as you would with a personal referral, look for depictions of the company’s customer service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Research Your Computer</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to prepare yourself for a successful computer repair is to know your device inside and out. Read up all that you can on your computer including your specs, serial number, and model type.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure where to start, begin with a quick Google search. You can find most information on the manufacturer’s website, and there’s usually a hotline number available if you’d rather speak to someone over the phone.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the more you can learn about your device beforehand, the better. Not only will this help familiarize you with your laptop or PC, but you’ll also be able to help guide your future technician’s service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Look For Certified Repair Shops</h2>
<p>While on the manufacturer’s website, you should also be able to see certified repair service dealers. Though these services are sometimes more expensive, you’re likely to receive higher quality services.</p>
<p>Moreover, try your best not to go with a large tech repair conglomerate. Though these services may be pretty easy to track down, you’re not likely to receive the same level of individualized care that you would with a <a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/computer-repair/">local computer repair</a> company. In addition, these companies may charge high prices since they have a decent level of exposure. For your wallet and quality of service, seek out a smaller repair service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Prioritize Remote Repair</h3>
<p>Some repair technicians will come straight to your door to service your computer. This will no doubt save you lots of time and money, as you won’t have to travel at all. However, sometimes this convenience can come at a cost, so prepare your budget accordingly.</p>
<p>Look on potential repair candidates’ websites to get a better idea of their service options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Budget Appropriately</h3>
<p>Before your initial consultation, ask yourself how much you can afford. Remember, just because computer repair companies have suggested price points, doesn’t mean you aren’t able to negotiate.</p>
<p>Compare prices across company websites and use that information to your advantage. During your first phone call, ask for direct prices so you’re not blindsided with a large bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Backup Data</h3>
<p>If at all possible, back up as much data as you can before seeking out computer repair services. Some companies will charge you extra to save your files when you can easily do this on your own with a little patience and research.</p>
<p>Should you not know where to start, make a quick Google search. There are tons of blog posts and informational videos out on the web about proper data backup. In the future, try to keep your important files on an external hard drive just in case something goes haywire. Not only will it give you peace of mind, but you’ll always have your files easily accessible in case you need to use a different device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Troubleshoot Preemptively</h3>
<p>After backing up your data, troubleshoot your computer with these basic <u><a href="http://geeksconnect.com.au/5-troubleshooting-tips-before-going-to-a-computer-repair-shop/">tips</a></u>. Sometimes, even just a little proactive troubleshooting can save you loads of time and money. Plus, you might learn more about your computer’s current state. Be sure to record all information gathered from your troubleshooting stage to relay to your repair technician. With this information, they are more likely to provide you with efficient service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Finding Computer Repair</h3>
<p>Finding a great computer repair technician is never easy. The whole process can be insanely stressful and can overcomplicate a number of areas in your life. However, remember that you will get your computer repaired in one way or another, especially by using these simple tips.</p>
